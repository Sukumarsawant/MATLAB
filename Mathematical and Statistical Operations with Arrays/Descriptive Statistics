Instructions are in the task pane to the left. Complete and submit each task one at a time.

This code sets up the activity.
load electricity
usage = ind+res+com;
yr = 1990:2019;

Task 1
annual = mean(usage,"omitnan")
plot(yr,annual)



Task 2
plot(yr,annual)


hold on
plot(yr,max(usage))
plot(yr,min(usage))
hold off

Task 3

monthly= mean(usage,2,"omitnan")
bar(monthly) %didnt know this

Task 4
maxUsage = max(usage,[],2,"omitnan")
minUsage = min(usage,[],2,"omitnan")


Task 5
plot(minUsage)
hold on 
plot(maxUsage)
hold off


Task 6
avgUse = mean(usage,"all","omitnan")
minUse = min(usage,[],"all","omitnan")
maxUse = max(usage,[],"all","omitnan")
