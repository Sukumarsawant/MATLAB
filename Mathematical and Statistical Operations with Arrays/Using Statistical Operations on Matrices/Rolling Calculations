This code sets up the activity.
load electricity
usage = ind+res+com;
firstYear = usage(:,1);
plot(firstYear,"o--")
price = price*1000/100;
revenue = price.*usage;

Task 1

diff1990 = diff(firstYear)
plot(diff1990)

Task 2

diffByMonth = diff(usage)

Task 3
plot(diffByMonth)


Task 4

[maxDiffMonths idxM ] = max(diffByMonth)
histogram(idxM)

Task 5

revCum = cumsum(revenue)
plot(revcum)
